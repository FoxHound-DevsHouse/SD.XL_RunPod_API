# Runpod AI API Integration

This Python script demonstrates how to integrate with the Runpod AI API to generate images based on user prompts and negative prompts.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have:

- Python installed on your system
- An API key from Runpod AI. You can obtain this by signing up for their service and creating an API key.

## Setup

1. Install the required Python packages using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

2. Replace `"APIKEY"` in the script with your actual Runpod AI API key.

3. Ensure your input payload (`payload` dictionary) is configured according to your requirements. Adjust parameters such as `user_prompt`, `num_inference_steps`, `refiner_inference_steps`, `width`, `height`, `guidance_scale`, `strength`, `seed`, `num_images`, and `negative_prompt` based on your desired image generation settings.

## Usage

1. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python runpod_api_integration.py
    ```

2. Upon execution, the script sends a POST request to the Runpod AI API with the user prompt and negative prompt provided in the payload.

3. The API generates an image based on the provided prompts and returns the image URL in the response.

4. The script then extracts the image URL from the API response and prints it.

## Script Explanation

- `url`: The endpoint for the Runpod AI API.
- `payload`: Configuration parameters including the user prompt, negative prompt, and various settings for image generation.
- `headers`: HTTP headers including content type and authorization. Replace `"APIKEY"` with your actual API key.
- `response`: Sends a POST request to the API and captures the response.
- `data`: Parses the JSON response from the API.
- `image_url`: Extracts the URL of the generated image from the API response.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure you comply with Runpod AI's terms of service and usage policies when using their API.
- This script provides a basic example of interacting with the Runpod AI API for image generation. For more complex interactions or integrations, consult the Runpod AI API documentation.
